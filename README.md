Product Design Challenge

For this challenge, you’re going to build a simple web page using bootstrap, css, and jquery (if you would like to build it with something else, you are more than welcome to!). You will be mocking up a wireframe of the customer profile for ALEX. Please upload the final files to github and send us the link, as well as adding the folder to the google share drive provided. Instructions below. 

1.	Create a folder on your desktop called the ‘ALEX product challenge’, which will contain the index, stylesheet, js, and any other assets you use for the design of the web page
2.	On the google drive link provided, create a folder with your name and date of upload, and add files related to your work there
3.	For this challenge, we have provided wireframes of the final product we want built. You will be building a customer profile for the website. Your job will to create the basic boxes and tabs, as seen in the sketch file PRODUCTCHALLENGE_WIREFRAME. You can also view it in the PDF provided with the same name.  This is a front end design challenge, so you do not need to worry about building our the backend that will pull the data that populates these boxes
•	Make profile picture box editable, so that a picture can be uploaded in the box
•	Make the information in first box (name, company, etc.) editable. Eventually this information will be populated with data from LinkedIn, but should be editable by the person with the profile
•	Link buttons to anyoneslearning.com, to see that they work
*** The page doesn’t need to look exactly like the wireframe, but make it as close to the design provided as possible
4.	When you are done, upload files to your folder on the drive, and send us an e-mail confirming that you have finished the challenge along with the github link
